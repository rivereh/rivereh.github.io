          <p>
            I graduated from the University of Washington in Computer Science
            and Software Engineering. My passion lies in solving complex
            problems and creating innovative solutions using the knowledge
            gained throughout my education. I&apos;m eager to apply my skills to
            real-world projects and continue learning and growing as a software
            engineer. My interests include full-stack web development and game
            development.
